<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lilia Tamayo, born and currently living in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico. My academic journey led me to become a Biochemical Engineer with a specialization in biotechnology and a Master of Science in Chemical and Biochemical Sciences. Among my greatest academic and professional achievements are having obtained the highest GPA in my program, the publication of a popular science article, a scientific paper, and the completion of my postgraduate studies. However, my greatest satisfaction comes from my personal growth. The academic path has been a journey of self-discovery—it has allowed me to develop greater self-confidence, manage my emotions effectively, and set personal boundaries. This has truly changed my life for the better.</p>

<p>My love for science is fueled by my innate curiosity and my need to understand the world. Science has given me the means to find answers and make sense of life. </p>

<p>I am characterized as a hyperactive, detail-oriented, analytical, empathetic, sensitive, fun, intelligent, self-critical, proactive, sincere person—and of course, a passionate dancer with a constant desire to acquire new knowledge!
  At this moment, I am in an exploratory stage, learning to program and improving my English, while working part-time.</p>

<p>My future goals are shared by many: to achieve financial freedom, travel without restrictions, have the freedom to learn whatever interests me, and to start a family.</p>

<p>My life philosophy centers on continuous improvement in every aspect, so I can offer the best of myself to my loved ones and to society.</p>
  
<p>My message to you is this: always believe in yourself and develop every skill you can, to multiply your chances of success.</p>
